# Fake Store Flutter
 A simple cart management syatem


## Description
This is a simple Cart Management application that integrates with the FakeStore API to fetch product data. Users can browse and add products to their cart, which is managed locally. The app seamlessly supports offline functionality by utilizing cached data previously fetched from the API, ensuring users can still view and manage their cart even without an active internet connection.
